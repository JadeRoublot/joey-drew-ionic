        <p>We are the Archive of the now infamous Joey Drew Studios.
           The studio of animation who was born in 1929, in direct competition with the Walt Disney studios.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>This logo was the first one ever use for the studios, far before it became what it is now.
           And far before most of our beloved character was ever drawn.</p>

        <p>Those two friends where Joey Drew (at the left) and Henry Stein (at the right).
           One was the dreamer, the head of the enterprise,  beloved by the journalists, and the other was the drawer, the designer, the maker of the design of so many characters.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Stein was known for being very reclusive, and it was one of the reasons he is always forgotten. He is in this studio what ub Iwerks is for Disney studios.</p>
